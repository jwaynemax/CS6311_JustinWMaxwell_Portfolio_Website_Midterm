                <dd class="resumeDescription">As a Product Manager at OneTrust, I work with OneTrust stakeholders
                    comprised of customers, professional services, and research and development
                    to provide superior products. I worked with our Data Discovery Scanner product, CORE and Platform
                    Services, and currently our Integration's product that enables the OneTrust platform
                    to receive and send data via REST and SOAP APIs, RDBMS Connection, and FTP (SFTP and FTPS). The
                    Integrations product allows users to store their third-party system credentials, build connections
                    through custom workflows or seeded wizards, and ultimately automate
                    the data flow between OneTrust and the customer's applications. As a Product Manager, I'm
                    responsible for the product lifecycle, assuring that sprints are managed and scoped realistically
                    with the help of lead developers and working with both internal and external stakeholders to ensure
                    we are providing needed features and addressing product bugs. Given that the main goal of
                    Integration's is to automate
                    the transfer of data between OneTrust modules and external systems, I've had extensive experience
                    working with a variety of different enterprise applications.
                    Day-to-day, I work with tools such as Jira, Confluence, Aha, and Salesforce for administrative
                    responsibilities.

                <dd class="resumeDescription">As a Senior Technical Implementation Consultant at OneTrust, I worked with
                    small to enterprise businesses on
                    implementing OneTrust’s technical modules. I had an opportunity to consult for a wide variety of
                    companies including some Fortune 500.
                    My main goal was to enable the OneTrust software to communicate seamlessly with our
                    client’s current systems. I assisted with building integrations with Salesforce, Pardot, Marketo,
                    Marketing Cloud,
                    etc. The modules I specialized in were Targeted Data Discovery (TDD), Universal Consent Management,
                    and PreferenceChoice.
                    I utilized JSON, REST and SOAP APIs, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Apache Freemarker (Java Template
                    Language), APEX, and Agile
                    Project Management methodology. I had the opportunity to work very closely with Product Owners and
                    Product
                    Managers to ensure our customers software needs were met. I worked extensively with our training
                    team to teach
                    OneTrust's Universal Consent Expert Certification course. I also maintained extensive familiarity
                    with current
                    privacy laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD.
