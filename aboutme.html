                    <h4>What am I up to?</h4>
                    <p>I currently claim the role of Product Manager at OneTrust. Here, I work closely with
                        our development team to build the best privacy, security, and third party risk solutions that
                        every organization needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am always looking for opportunities to better myself as well as my career - which is why I
                        currently am pursuing my Master's in Applied Computer Science at West Georgia.

                    <h4>How did I get here?</h4>
                    <p>Growing up, I was the kid who spent hours jailbreaking his iPod. Every time I got a new toy or
                        technology, I was immediately taking it apart and learning how to put it back together - but
                        figuring out how to make it better. During my senior year of college, I realized my passion for
                        Development and dove headfirst into the world of computer science.
                    </p>

                    <h4>When I’m not working (or in class)...</h4>
                    <p>Music is my muse. At a young age, I picked up a guitar for the first time and instantly felt at
                        home. I love to stay active and challenge myself through CrossFit - at other times, you can find
                        me laid back, watching Star Wars, with a pint of Ben & Jerry’s Half Baked ice cream. On the
                        weekends, I enjoy hunting down new outdoor trails with close friends and hiking.
